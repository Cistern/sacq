libab is a C library to broadcast messages to a cluster of nodes. libab also
provides powerful properties for broadcasted messages:

1. Each successfully broadcasted message is guaranteed to be delivered to a majority of the nodes.
2. Broadcasted messages are fully serialized through an elected leader.

Traffic is sent over TCP with transparent reconnections.

Encryption is also supported and is implemented using [tweetnacl](https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/)
with a shared key (provided by the user).
